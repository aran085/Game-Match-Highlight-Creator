This project is aimed at obtaining highlights from the full match video, without using *computer vision and NLP!* Yes, you read that right.

We always think that obtaining such videos would require deep learning and stuff to generate. But what if we could do so, by applying some simple concepts of energy threshold in audio waves to get a basic highlights package, if not as good as state-of-the-art? :grin:

* [ ] Automatically generate the audio
